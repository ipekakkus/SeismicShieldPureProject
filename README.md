# SeismicShieldPureProject


*Project Introduction*

In response to the heightened earthquake risks in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul, our team is developing a mobile communication application dedicated to reducing and managing earthquake risks for the Sabanci University community. This application is designed to address the needs of staff, instructors, and students across three critical phases: pre-disaster, during the disaster, and post-disaster.

*Objective*

The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly mobile app that provides timely information, effective communication channels, and essential resources to enhance earthquake preparedness, response, and recovery efforts within the Sabanci University community. Our approach includes the development of sustainable communication methods to mitigate the effects of potential electricity and global internet connectivity issues during emergencies.

*Features*

Welcome & User Registration: A welcoming screen with options for language selection and user registration. Ensures that all users, including staff, instructors, and students, can personalize their experience and receive targeted alerts.
User Profile Management: Allows users to update and manage their personal information, including academic details, contact information, and health-related data.
Pre-Disaster Planning: Features tools to help users prepare before an earthquake. This includes an emergency kit checklist and custom tips for preparedness at the university level.
Real-Time Alerts: The app provides instant notifications about earthquakes and other related emergencies, ensuring all users receive timely updates.
Resource Mapping: Interactive maps and resources for emergency preparedness, showing key locations and what to do in various disaster scenarios.
Emergency Contacts: Quick access to important contacts and emergency numbers, which is crucial during a disaster when rapid response is needed.
Community Communication: In-app messaging and communication features allow for seamless interaction among community members during an emergency.
Health & Safety Information: Users can store and access their health information, like blood type and allergies, which could be vital during emergencies.
Personalized Daily Tips: Daily advice and tips related to earthquake safety, helping to enhance everyday preparedness.

*Methodology*

Literature Review: Analyze existing emergency applications and earthquake preparedness strategies.
Simulation of Earthquake Scenarios: Test the applicationâ€™s functionality under various simulated earthquake conditions to ensure robust performance.
Software Development: Follow agile methodologies for iterative development and testing of the app features.
